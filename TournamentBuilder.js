/* this is a basic tournament builder based off a VBA project
I did for a VBA class i took in college. I will be using this
project to learn versioning and become accustomed to gradually building
programs over time. 

The tournament builder takes a list of players and available teams, and randomly
assigns a team to each player. I used this program to create a Madden tournament,
where participants were randomly assigned a NFL team to use in a playoff-style
tournament bracket. */

// Version .01 - basic variables and function names created


// initialize empty arrays to house both players and teams
var players = [];
var teams = [];
var entries = [];

function addPlayer(name) {
// prompts the tournament organizer for the name of a player, and adds the input to the players array

}

function addTeam(name) {
//prompts the tournament organizer for the name of a team, and adds the input to the team array

}

function assignTeams(players, teams) {
//assigns a team to each player, and returns an object with the player and team to the entries array.
//removes the player and team from their respective arrays

}
